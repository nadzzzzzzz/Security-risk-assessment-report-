# Network Security Enhancement Project

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to improving and documenting the network security practices for our social media organization. Following a significant data breach that compromised customer personal information, our goal is to harden our network defenses to prevent future breaches and enhance overall security.

## Background
Our organization recently suffered a data breach that exposed sensitive customer data, including names and addresses. An internal security audit revealed four major vulnerabilities that contributed to the breach:
1. Employees sharing passwords.
2. Use of default passwords for database administration.
3. Inadequate firewall rules to filter incoming and outgoing traffic.
4. Lack of Multifactor Authentication (MFA) across critical systems.

## Objectives
This project aims to:
- Eliminate poor password management practices.
- Strengthen firewall configurations.
- Implement Multifactor Authentication (MFA).
- Document the progress and solutions for network hardening.

## Implementation Strategies
### Password Management
- **Tool:** Integrate a robust Password Management System (PMS) to generate, store, and manage complex passwords.
- **Policy:** Establish strict policies against password sharing among employees.

### Firewall Enhancement
- **Tool:** Deploy advanced Firewall Management Software to enhance traffic filtering and threat detection capabilities.
- **Action:** Define and enforce comprehensive firewall rules for both inbound and outbound traffic.

### Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
- **Tool:** Implement an MFA solution to require additional verification methods beyond just passwords, thereby securing access to critical systems.
- **Deployment:** Roll out MFA for all access points, focusing initially on high-risk areas.

## Documentation
This repository will contain all documentation related to:
- Security policies and protocols developed.
- Implementation guides and notes for tools and software adopted.
- Regular updates on the progress and effectiveness of the security enhancements.
